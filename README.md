# Python-challenge
#Create a new GitHub repo called python-challenge. Then, clone it to your computer.

Inside your local git repository, create a directory for both of the  Python Challenges. Use folder names corresponding to the challenges: PyBank and  PyPoll.

Inside of each folder that you just created, add a new file called main.py. This will be the main script to run for each analysis.

Push the above changes to GitHub.


PyBank


Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset.

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.

The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

PyPoll

You will be give a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote.
